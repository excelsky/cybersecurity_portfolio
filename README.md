# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This is a place that I show what I have accomplished in cybersecurity.


Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio, a comprehensive showcase of my journey and expertise in the field of information security. This site serves as a dynamic repository of my professional accomplishments, technical skills, and ongoing projects in the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity.

Currently, this page shows my on-going achievement in Google Cybersecurity Certificate. 

Soon, I will include my academic achievements here, including papers I published. They may be code samples demonstrating my proficiency in security scripting, network diagrams illustrating complex security architectures I've designed.
